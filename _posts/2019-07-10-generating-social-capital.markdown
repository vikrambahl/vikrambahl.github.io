In her course/book, *The Science of Success*, Paula Caproni discusses several key contributors to success. Social Capital is one such critical contributor and just like financial capital or human capital, needs careful planning and management.

Science of success is an excellent course on Coursera. Its rather light and breezy as opposed to the programming courses or financial trading courses I've been taking. My favorite part of the course is  the one that discussed social capital.

Paula stresses the need to build social capital and how its a need, not a good-to-have. And while I found myself agreeing with most of what she said, a few things really resonated. 

### 1. If I perform I am a good citizen is a myth

I am not quite certain when and where did I get this notion. Maybe during my years in the startup or maybe because I've always been in technology. When the system crashes and you are the only one who can bring it back to life, you start valuing that competence beyond anything. I am sure that's how I would treat a doctor or a lawyer. You might be unpleasant or horrible (within boundaries) but if you are the one who can solve this problem, I am okay with working with you. My boundary here is that you shouldn't be a malicious sociopath / psychopath. However, in reality, I, in my current role, and in fact most people are nowhere near as critical. Nobody wants to work with a jerk. It's not worth it. So be a decent fella and don't be obnoxious (even though Trump still made it to becoming the president of the United States, but that might be a reflection on the state of that country and its politicians). 

Being great at your job doesn't mean you can dispose off with the relationships. Nobody succeeds alone.

### 2. Treat it as capital - Not every investment will yield returns

Now this was not covered in the course. But when I reflected upon this social capital scenario, I just couldn't get myself to try and build relationships with certain people, just like some people would hate to build one with me. But that's all right. Its important to invest in relationships, which are nurturing and built on mutual respect and trust. Spend just about as much time and effort in choosing your peers, as you would in maintaining that relationship with them.
