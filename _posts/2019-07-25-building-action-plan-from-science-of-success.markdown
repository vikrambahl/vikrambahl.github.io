## The Heart, Head and Hands

The five step action plan is divided into three broad categories. 
- Step 1 and 2 fall under the heart. Heart helps us identify what is that matters to us the most, what our values are and how do we prioritize our life goals.
- Head drives step 3 where we recognizes feasibility and viability of our goals. We consider tradeoffs and resources and focus on achievability
- Hands make up the next 2 steps, Step 4 and 5 where we define the exact actions that we'll take to achieve our goals.

### Step 01: Heart - The most important parts of your life

This one is pretty straightforward. We categorize which aspects of our lives are the most important. Usually, for most of us, its family, work/career, money/finances and health. 

### Step 02: Heart - Individual goals in each aspect

Next, we add upto two or three most important goals under each of the category. 

| # | Health | Family | Finances | Work |
|---|--------|---------|----------|------|
| 1 | Lose weight to reach a healthy BMI | Enhance kids' physical and mental capabilities | Pay off the mortgage | Increase your social capital amidst your peers |
| 2 | Increase stamina and muscle weight to be able to play sports | Decrease screen time within home | Plan for retirement | Prepare yourself for economic depression in job market | 
| 3 | Improve mental health and feel happier | Increase mindfulness when I am with family | Prepare a plan on how to fund retirement | Build a work stream that makes you financially independent

### Step 03: Head - Choose one goal

Choose one goal from all of the goals that you wrote. Write down why you chose that specific goal and make peace with the fact that for now, you are okay to de-prioritize other aspects. You don't neglect those other aspects, just that you don't make any significant changes in your life to further that aspect. 

For example, 
Enhance kids physical and mental capabilities

The reason for selecting this particular goal is that the quicker I achieve this, the better it is for the kids and for my family. It is also a low hanging fruit and I would expect that once I have nudged them in the right direction and they start enjoying sports or a certain language, they would automatically carry this on their own. Finally, the earlier kids identify their own passion, the more time they would get to better themselves at it.

### Step 04: Break down and write the exact steps that you'll take to achieve that one goal

Its important to write down these exact steps. What will you do first, then next until you have reached your goal. When would you be doing these steps and how will you figure out whether you have completed the step or not.

Its critical that each one of these steps are small wins. Nothing should require more than 2-3 weeks to complete/setup. 

### Step 05: Decide what all activities will you stop doing

Its just as critical to define what we must stop doing so as to find time. Alternatively, you could use this as a reward only after you have finished off with the action item for the day. 

### Step 06: Consolidate learnings

Because of the way our mind works, we might 

### The power of small wins

Its critical that you setup small wins because they create a domino effect and set you up for success. That doesn't mean we set up an expectation that we can't or won't fail. However, we must ensure that we collect those small victories for it'll keep us motivated. Finally the advice from the author is to not strive for balance within life. With all of its vagaries, life can get unsettled pretty quickly. There will be ups and downs and trying to keep things in balance could be exhausting and still not yield any sense of achievement. Instead strive for a meaningful life, a fulfilled life.
